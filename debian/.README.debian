cxterm for DEBIAN
----------------------

- For cxterm-big5 and cxterm-ks, the default fonts are taipei16 and
  hanglm16 respectively. However the alias of these fonts are not
  present in fonts.alias after you have installed the corresponding
  fonts. Therefore you need to add the alias to fonts.alias
  manually before starting cxterm.
