Aug 25, 2013 cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + HZtable.h - fix compilation against newer xorg
      libX11-devel header
    + cxterm.spec - minor update to the spec file regarding font
      location
Feb 28, 2006 cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + main.c - unitialised pointer and missing unix98 prototypes (the 
      strcpy'ed char *) causes segfaults on x86_64.
      Changed obsolete "Copyright" tag to "License" in spec file,
      and bumped version up.
	
Aug 26, 2004 cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + Added "cxterm-color" termcap and terminfo entry -
      only added enough extra from X11R6.6 xterm entry
      to make color/attribute(bold/underline/reverse/blink) work.
      and changed cxterm's own TERM identification to "cxterm-color",
      and only fall back to "cxterm" if there is no "cxterm-color"
      termcap/terminfo entry. See README.terminfo

    + Strange to note, just fix a bug with erratic cursor movement 
      and screen corruption during resizing; the bug was introduced
      8-9 years ago by the color-patch. Basically the cursor
      is all over the place and the wrong part of the off-screen
      buffer has been copied during a resize. Guess most people just
      do a clear screen on resize and it doesn't bother people enough
      that the cursor should be in a sensible position after resize.
      Good to have xterm's 9 years of cvs repository for reference!
	
Aug 05, 2004 cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + More change to cemacs.el to disable mule default to scratch
      buffer.
	
Aug 04, 2004 cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + Redhat problem again. Fedora 2 shipped with the optional legacy BSD
      pty mode in the 2.6 kernel switched off. Well, cxterm is very old...
      Merged unix98-related code-changes and small extras fom xterm's source
      over the last 9 years since the fork. Now uses the newer 
      unix98-style ptys on linux. Probably will break other platforms. Caution!

08/21/2003 cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + Redhat 9 problem - it sets LANG by default, and cemacs misbehaves 
      under either LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 (UK default) or LANG=zh_TW.big5 .
      Updated cemacs.el to internally unset every clever things that 
      the mule part of emacs switches on by mistake due to LANG being set.

7/5/2003 cvs - Changsen Xu <xucs007@yahoo.com>
    + Systematic GB WuBi method correction (refered to Windows ChenXi WuBi
	³¿êØÎå±Ê, version 6.5, 2002, and Doc/WuBiCode_1986.txt). Code of 60
	characters, and all orders of same-code characters were corrected.

    + WuBi code name changed from 11, 12, 13, etc. to letters, so as to ease
      input-code reading at cross-checking.

06/13/2003  cvs - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + added emacs notes and cemacs.el scripts 
	
05/06/2003  cxterm-5.2.3 - Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + updated ./depcomp and ./missing from GNU automake 1.7

    + Misc relocation fixes to do with rpm generation.

    + Adapted termcap and terminfo from X.Org's X11R6.6 for cxterm.
	
06/08/2002  cxterm-5.2.3pre Hin-Tak Leung <htl10@users.sourceforge.net>
    + Fixed most of the warnings flagged by GCC's -Wall option

    + migrated to ANSI C prototyping with GCC's protoize

    + Fixed autoconf problem on Cygwin. 

    + Added ./depcomp and ./missing from GNU automake 1.6.1 (needed by
      the configure script and missing in 5.2.2).


12/06/2001  cxterm-5.2.2    released by Changsen Xu <xucs007@yahoo.com>
    + F3 popup size fix. 
	- updated cxterm/HZpopup.c

    + Fixed ESCAPE problem of GB Chinese (BIG5/JIS/KS already
      function this way): pressing ESCAPE key in the inserting mode of
      vi/vim will not only switch to command mode, but also switch from
      any Chinese input method to ASCII input method. 
	- updated scripts/cxtermrc.tpl

11/28/2001  cxterm-5.2.1 released by Changsen Xu <xucs007@yahoo.com>
    + Fixed scrollbar problem after autoconf introduced: Must define
      NARROWPROTO when compiling.

11/27/2001  cxterm-5.2.0 released by Changsen Xu <xucs007@yahoo.com>
    + autoconf introduced. This is quite some changes, so I set version as 5.2.
      For cygwin, further fixes will be needed (I don't know cygwin).



11/13/2001  cxterm-5.1p2.src.tgz released by Changsen Xu <xucs007@yahoo.com>

    + Input key cross reference for the last CJK character (of a phrase)
      inputed: Double-hit of any function key (F#) within 1 second will
      show you corresponding InputKeys in that method.

    + Set up hosting on sourceforge.net: http://cxterm.sourceforge.net,
      but cvs don't support symbolic links, so I move scripts/config.sh
      to the root directory. Other symbolic links in root directory to
      Doc subDirectory, such as README, version etc., thus were "removed".

    + GB Chinese "Ô¹" in the old WuBi.tit has wrong key: dbn/dbnu; It's
      corrected to Ï¦¶úÐÄu (qbn or qbnu) --- the later is used by most
      Windows 95/98/NT/2000 WuBi methods.


03/26/2001   cxterm-5.1p1-2.src.rpm released (can be found on
    http://rpmfind.net ) by Heng Yuan <heng@ag.arizona.edu>

    + Script fixes, RPM re-packaging.



06/12/1999  cxterm 5.1p1 released by ZHUANG Hao <hz69@columbia.edu>

    + 1) Blinking support for the CXterm. Now you can see the flashing words !
  
    + 2) True ANSI color support. Now the CXterm supports hilight colors and
         normal colors. (16 foreground + 8 background)
  
    + 3) FIXED: abnormal display while typing Chinese Characters in BBS;
  
    + 4) FIXED: strange color block leftover when the cursor jumps to other
         locations;
  
    + 5) FIXED: the color of the Chinese Input Line changes with the last
         character displayed on screen.
  
    + 6) Special color processing for BBS, use '-bbs on/off' switches or the
         X resource string 'cxterm*bbs' to turn it on or off.
  
    + 7) Chinese mode on/off by pressing <Ctrl> key, but won't be affected by
         normal <Ctrl>+<key> press. (But you can set it to any key, like
         <Shift>, <Meta>... See the resource file for more info)
  
    + 8) Default RichWin-like Chinese input key settings: use - and = to
         search back or forward... makes the punctuation input more convenient.
         But you can change it if you don't like. (This default is for GB
         only)
  
    + 9) Some secure protection.
