CXTERM VERSION 5.1 PATCH LEVEL 1
** June 12, 1999 **

This package contains all the source files needed to make a color
cxterm 5.1. To build the color cxterm, unpack the files and run the
shell script -- config.sh

Fixes and enhancement have been made by Mr. Zhuang Hao on the basis of
color CXterm version 5.0.p3. Great thanks to the former authors for their
contributions. Please remember these names:

  Yongguang Zhang: Original Version  5.0.p3, B&W.   1995
  Ji-Tzay Yang & Bruce Cheng: Add color to CXterm   1996-1997

The final version 5.1 adds new features to the former releases and
support true ANSI color scheme, and enhancement for BBS color.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes and Fixes made:

  1) Blinking support for the CXterm. Now you can see the flashing words !
  2) True ANSI color support. Now the CXterm supports hilight colors and
     normal colors. (16 foreground + 8 background)
  3) FIXED: abnormal display while typing Chinese Characters in BBS;
  4) FIXED: strange color block leftover when the cursor jumps to other
     locations;
  5) FIXED: the color of the Chinese Input Line changes with the last
     character displayed on screen.
  6) Special color processing for BBS, use '-bbs on/off' switches or the
     X resource string 'cxterm*bbs' to turn it on or off.
  7) Chinese mode on/off by pressing <Ctrl> key, but won't be affected by
     normal <Ctrl>+<key> press. (But you can set it to any key, like
     <Shift>, <Meta>... See the resource file for more info)
  8) Default RichWin-like Chinese input key settings: use - and = to
     search back or forward... makes the punctuation input more convenient.
     But you can change it if you don't like. (This default is for GB
     only)
  9) Some secure protection.

The default color mapping complies to SGI's default RGB map. You are free
to change it as you like.

I have successfully compiled and run the package on the following
platforms:

  * Linux Debian (slink, kernel 2.0.36) [X11R6]
  * FreeBSD 2.2.6 Release [X11R6]
  * IRIX 5.3 [X11R6]
  * Solaris 2.5.1 [X11R5]
  * HP-UX 10.0 [X11R5]

Make sure your X development package works well with your C compiler.

You do NOT have to download the xfonts directory by default. Everything
you need is in the tar ball. However, there are some more fonts in this
directory:

  * 16-pixel Fang Song fonts. This fonts is thinner and makes your CXterm
    screen look nice. However, the same font is shipped with recent Linux
    and FreeBSD release. Check your system first or you'll waste your
    space. The name may be 'hanzigb16fs'.
  * 24-pixel Song Ti. You can protect your eye-sight by applying large
    fonts. Why not have a try ? :)

Thanks for your feedback.
