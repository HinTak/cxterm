11/13/2001  cxterm-5.1p2.src.tgz released by Changsen Xu <xucs007@yahoo.com>

    + Input key cross reference for the last CJK character (of a phrase)
      inputed: Double-hit of any function key (F#) within 1 second will
      show you corresponding InputKeys in that method.

    + Set up hosting on sourceforge.net: http://cxterm.sourceforge.net,
      but cvs don't support sysbolic links, so I move scripts/config.sh
      to the root directory. Other symbolic links in root directory to
      Doc subDirectory, such as README, version etc., thus were "removed".

    + GB Chinese "Ô¹" in the old WuBi.tit has wrong key: dbn/dbnu; It's
      corrected to Ï¦¶úÐÄu (qbn or qbnu) --- the later is used by most
      Windows 95/98/NT/2000 WuBi methods.


03/26/2001   cxterm-5.1p1-2.src.rpm released (can be found on
    http://rpmfind.net ) by Heng Yuan <heng@ag.arizona.edu>

    + Script fixes, RPM re-packaging.



06/12/1999  cxterm 5.1p1 released by ZHUANG Hao <hz69@columbia.edu>

    + 1) Blinking support for the CXterm. Now you can see the flashing words !
  
    + 2) True ANSI color support. Now the CXterm supports hilight colors and
         normal colors. (16 foreground + 8 background)
  
    + 3) FIXED: abnormal display while typing Chinese Characters in BBS;
  
    + 4) FIXED: strange color block leftover when the cursor jumps to other
         locations;
  
    + 5) FIXED: the color of the Chinese Input Line changes with the last
         character displayed on screen.
  
    + 6) Special color processing for BBS, use '-bbs on/off' switches or the
         X resource string 'cxterm*bbs' to turn it on or off.
  
    + 7) Chinese mode on/off by pressing <Ctrl> key, but won't be affected by
         normal <Ctrl>+<key> press. (But you can set it to any key, like
         <Shift>, <Meta>... See the resource file for more info)
  
    + 8) Default RichWin-like Chinese input key settings: use - and = to
         search back or forward... makes the punctuation input more convenient.
         But you can change it if you don't like. (This default is for GB
         only)
  
    + 9) Some secure protection.
