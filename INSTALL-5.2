			============
			INSTALLATION
			============
After introduce autoconf in cxterm-5.2, now it's more simple to install:
	./configure
	make 
	make install

We can install to different directories by using:
	./configure --prefix=YourPrefixDirectory
The default prefix directory is /usr/local.

By default, binaries are installed to /usr/local/bin, man files to
/usr/local/man/man1, other dictionaries and fonts are installed to
/usr/local/share/cxterm.

To uninstall:
	make uninstall


			============
			    USAGE
			============
cxterm.bin is the binary, cxterm is a wrapping script.
	cxterm		#to show GB-Chinese
	cxterm -b5	#to show Big5-Chinese
	cxterm -jis	#to show Japanese
	cxterm -ks	#to show Korean



			=============
			    FONTS
			=============
Since XFree86 now already contains some CJK fonts, cxterm-5.2 doesn't
install fonts by default. In case you are not using the most recent
XFree86, 3 Chinese fonts are provided. Run:
	make install-fonts
will install the 3 fonts to: {prefix}/share/cxterm/fonts

Then you need to add the following line to your shell startup files
(~/.bashrc or ~/.tcshrc):
	xset fp+ {prefix}/share/cxterm/fonts
Don't forget to replace the {prefix} to your real installation prefix
directory.

If you wish to use other fonts, say Japanese or Korean fonts, you'll
further need to change FONT variable in the `cxterm` script
correspondingly.

`xlsfonts | grep ...` command can be used to check which fonts you
can use under X-Windows.
