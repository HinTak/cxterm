cxterm is a localized Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) X-terminal.
Original author is YONGGUANG ZHANG AND MAN-CHI PONG.

More historical files are in the Doc/ directory. The installation
method described in the Doc/ has expired after autoconf was
introduced to cxterm-5.2 . See the 'INSTALL' file for detailes.

The original authors have made the copyright statement in Doc/COPYRIGHT.
Looks like GNU General Public License (GPL) to me.

The ChangeLog is previous Doc/HISTORY -- just to be more GNU-like.


===================================================================
    Please help me to fix cygwin installation with autoconf !!!
    I don't have any experience with cygwin.  You may need to
    refer to the previous 5.1p2 version in order to do this.
